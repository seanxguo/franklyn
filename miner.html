				<h2>A MOBILE REDESIGN CONCEPT OF AMAZON MTURK</h2>
			</div>

			<p>
				Amazon MTurk is an online platform that allows researchers (Requesters) to request crowdsourced solutions to various tasks (completed by Workers). This side project sought to imagine what a mobile-first re-design of MTurk might look like.

				This project somehow led me to join the Stanford Crowd Research Collective, a worldwide group of researchers led by Michael Bernstein in Stanford CS, to help build the next generation crowdsourcing marketplace.
			</p>

			<h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF MOBILE-FIRST IN CROWDSOURCING</h2>			
			<p>
				Mobile browsing of digital media is growing rapidly in the 21st century, and has now surpassed desktop usage (KPCB Internet Trends, 2015). The average American spends 2.8 hours a day browsing digital media on a mobile device, and 2.4 on a desktop/laptop. Mobile usage has grown over 9 times since 2008 (KPCB Internet Trends, 2015), and seems to still be on the rise. How does MTurk fare in terms of mobile support?
			</p>

			<h2>MTURK IS NOT MOBIL

			E FRIENDLY</h2>

			<p>
				A lack of mobile-first design precludes a Worker's ability to do many types of tasks on MTurk in that free time. According to a survey that I conducted (80 participants, online survey), 69% of participants used MTurk on laptops, only 5% using smartphones. However, 47% reported at times wanting to use MTurk, but being unable to due to lack of laptop. If a mobile version of MTurk existed, 76% of participants said that they would use it, and 41% participants said they would prefer a mobile client over a laptop client. 

				The user interface is certainly not optimized for mobile usage:

				<br>

				88% of Workers agreed that the UI could be improved. Many tasks on MTurk are extremely tedious and boring; this is exacerbated by the lack of satisfying visual and interactive feedback. MTurk workers reported being bored 45% of the time, and start clicking randomly due to boredom 15% of the time.
			</p>

			<h2>REIMAGINING MTURK FOR MOBILE</h2>
			<p>
				I imagined a mobile interface with the following characteristics:
				<ul>
					<li>A more visually appealing interface with satisfying interactive feedback, including a more user friendly way to respond to questions</li>
					<li>Statistics about requesters and HITs clearly presented</li>
					<li>A way to better inform Workers what a HIT entails</li>
					<li>A better way to filter for HITs</li>
				</ul>
